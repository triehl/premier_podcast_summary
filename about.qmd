# Overview

- **Description:** This app analyzes the [Premier's call-in radio show](https://globalnews.ca/edmonton/program/your-province-your-premier){target=\"_blank\"} to identify insights related to physicians and the healthcare system

- **Goal:** Assist PC&E staff identify comments and policy statements made by the Premier which may impact the AMA without having to listen to the entire show

# User responsibilities

The episode transcript is computer generated from the radio show audio files. As a result, some acronyms or text may not be transcribed correctly or speakers may be misidentified. **The user is responsible for confirming the actual content from the audio file before quoting from an episode.**

# How It Works

1. **RSS Monitoring**: The app scans the [radio show RSS feed](https://globalnews.ca/edmonton/program/your-province-your-premier){target=\"_blank\"} for new episodes
2. **Transcription**: Episodes are transcribed using AssemblyAI with speaker identification and timestamps
2. **Transcript theming**: Claude AI analyzes the transcript to identify caller themes and create timestamped headers ([example](https://connect.albertadoctors.org/he-reports/premiers-radio-show/episodes/2025-12-20-your-province-your-premier-12202025_transcript.html){target=\"_blank\"})
3. **Content Analysis**: Claude AI analyzes the transcript for healthcare-related content and identifies key quotes from the Premier ([example](https://connect.albertadoctors.org/he-reports/premiers-radio-show/episodes/2025-12-20-your-province-your-premier-12202025.html){target=\"_blank\"})
4. **Audio Clips**: Audio clips of the key quotes are extracted so they can easily be verified
5. **Publication**: Results are compiled into this Quarto book
