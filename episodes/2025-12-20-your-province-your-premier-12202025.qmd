## Healthcare Highlights

### Key Points

**[45:13 - 45:45]** Premier Smith identifies healthcare as top priority for 2026, specifically mentioning physician attachment, surgical backlogs, and patient experience improvements. States restructuring phase is complete and ready for implementation.

> "So much on healthcare. I wish I could say just one, but it's what I'm looking forward to. Seeing people get attached to a family doctor or nurse practitioner, improving the patient experience to get into surgery, clearing the surgical background backlog. Those are the things that we're working really hard on next year and we're finally at the point where we finished all of our restructuring and so now we get to implement and I'm looking forward to really greatly improving the patient experience."

### Additional Mentions

**[10:54 - 16:55]** Discussion of barriers to accessing federal disability benefits, including requirement for multiple doctor appointments creating burden on already-strained healthcare system. Premier acknowledges communication issues and considering using provincially-approved doctors for assessments.

> "I've already sent a note to my assisted living and social services minister to see if there's a way that we could have our own approved doctors be able to do these kinds of assessments, because some of the dollar figures we saw in that one report of $430 to go see a doctor seemed pretty high to us."

*Topics: primary care, family doctors, healthcare access, healthcare system capacity*
