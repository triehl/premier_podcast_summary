## Healthcare Highlights

### Key Points

**[45:05 - 45:35]** Premier Smith identifies healthcare improvements as her top priority for 2026, specifically mentioning family doctor attachment, surgical backlog reduction, and improved patient experience following completion of healthcare system restructuring.

> "I wish I could say just one, but it's what I'm looking forward to. Seeing people get attached to a family doctor or nurse practitioner, improving the patient experience to get into surgery, clearing the surgical background backlog. Those are the things that we're working really hard on next year and we're finally at the point where we finished all of our restructuring and so now we get to implement and I'm looking forward to really greatly improving the patient experience."

*Topics: family doctors, primary care, surgical backlog, patient experience, healthcare restructuring*

### Additional Mentions

**[10:54 - 16:55]** Extended discussion of barriers AISH recipients face in accessing the Canada Disability Benefit, including the need for multiple doctor appointments and associated costs ($430 mentioned). Premier commits to exploring whether provincial doctors could conduct assessments to reduce barriers.

> "I've already sent a note to my assisted living and social services minister to see if there's a way that we could have our own approved doctors be able to do these kinds of assessments, because some of the dollar figure figures we saw in that one report of $430 to go see a doctor seemed pretty high to us."

*Topics: doctors, medical assessments, healthcare access, disability support, physician shortages*
