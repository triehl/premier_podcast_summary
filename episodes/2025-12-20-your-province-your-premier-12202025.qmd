## Healthcare Highlights

### Key Points

**[45:13 - 45:45]** Premier Smith outlines her 2026 healthcare priorities, emphasizing family doctor attachment, improving patient experience, and clearing surgical backlogs as key goals after completing healthcare system restructuring.

> "I wish I could say just one, but it's what I'm looking forward to. Seeing people get attached to a family doctor or nurse practitioner, improving the patient experience to get into surgery, clearing the surgical background backlog. Those are the things that we're working really hard on next year and we're finally at the point where we finished all of our restructuring and so now we get to implement and I'm looking forward to really greatly improving the patient experience."

*Topics: primary care, family doctors, surgical wait times, patient experience, healthcare reform*

### Additional Mentions

**[10:54 - 16:55]** Extended discussion about AISH benefit application challenges, including concerns about the burden on the healthcare system requiring four separate doctor appointments for federal benefit applications, and difficulties for recipients without family doctors.

> "Having said that, that's four doctor's appointments and I have a family doctor one to tell him we have to do paperwork. He says I don't have time now. Rebook and we'll do it. So that's two for the tax credit, two more for the benefit."

*Topics: family doctors, physician access, healthcare system burden, disability benefits, primary care capacity*

**[16:55 - 17:30]** Premier Smith acknowledges the doctor assessment barrier for AISH applicants and commits to exploring whether provincial doctors could conduct these assessments, after seeing reports of high costs ($430) for required medical assessments.

> "I've already sent a note to my assisted living and social services minister to see if there's a way that we could have our own approved doctors be able to do these kinds of assessments, because some of the dollar figure figures we saw in that one report of $430 to go see a doctor seemed pretty high to us."

*Topics: physician costs, medical assessments, healthcare access, provincial healthcare policy*
