## Healthcare Highlights

### Key Points

**[10:54 - 16:18]** Discussion about AISH program complications and healthcare system burden, with caller Jerry highlighting that the federal disability benefit application process requires up to four doctor appointments, straining an already short-staffed healthcare system, particularly affecting those without family doctors.

> "Having said that, that's four doctor's appointments and I have a family doctor one to tell him we have to do paperwork. He says I don't have time now. Rebook and we'll do it. So that's two for the tax credit, two more for the benefit."

*Topics: primary care, family medicine, healthcare system capacity, doctor shortages, patient access*

**[16:18 - 16:40]** Premier Smith acknowledges the barrier of expensive doctor assessments for disability benefits, noting reports of $430 fees, and commits to exploring using provincially approved doctors for these assessments to reduce costs and improve access.

> "I've already sent a note to my assisted living and social services minister to see if there's a way that we could have our own approved doctors be able to do these kinds of assessments, because some of the dollar figures we saw in that one report of $430 to go see a doctor seemed pretty high to us."

*Topics: medical services, healthcare costs, access to care, physician services*

**[42:55 - 43:45]** Premier Smith responds positively to closing question about concrete improvements for 2026, emphasizing healthcare as top priority with specific focus on family doctor attachment, surgical backlog reduction, and improving overall patient experience after completing system restructuring.

> "So much on healthcare. I wish I could say just one, but it's what I'm looking forward to. Seeing people get attached to a family doctor or nurse practitioner, improving the patient experience to get into surgery, clearing the surgical background backlog. Those are the things that we're working really hard on next year and we're finally at the point where we finished all of our restructuring and so now we get to implement."

*Topics: primary care, family medicine, surgical wait times, patient care, healthcare system reform, nurse practitioners*
