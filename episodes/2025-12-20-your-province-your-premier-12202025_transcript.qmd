## [00:00] Opening

**WAYNE NELSON:** Welcome to your province, you, Premier heard on QR Calgary and in Edmonton on 880 Chad. I'm Wayne Nelson, your host and moderator and this is your final opportunity this year to speak with the premier directly to ask your questions, to voice your concerns. Whatever's on your mind, please keep those questions or texts as short as possible. Premier Smith, welcome back to the show.

## [00:57] Alberta Next Panel Report

**PREMIER DANIELLE SMITH:** Oh, hi Wayne. I guess this is our Last 1 of 2025.

**WAYNE NELSON:** It is indeed. And now two developments could shape Alberta politics in 2026 yesterday's release of the Alberta Next panel's final report, and the growing wave of citizen petitions. So let's start with the panel. It recommends referendums on provincial control over immigration and unconstitutional reforms, including some shielding of provincial powers, potential judicial appointment reforms, and even abolishing the federal Senate. It also calls for continued work on a provincial police service and detailed planning for an Alberta pension plan before any vote takes place. However, public polling suggests a lot of Albertans are more focused on those bread and butter issues. Housing affordability, classroom overcrowding, health care. How do you reconcile that focus with the panel recommendations?

**PREMIER DANIELLE SMITH:** Well, you can do it all. I mean, when you're in government, we have 24 departments and each one of them has their priorities. And so we are focused on those on a daily basis and during our sessions. However, these big conversations about our evolving relationship with Ottawa has been very much in the backdrop for probably 30 years. That's how long I've been following this. And there have been various consultations that have shown increasing support for us to develop more aspects of what's called responsible government. The bigger you get, the more money you have, the more population you have, the more things you should do on your own. So that was the so I think we can look at them as two different things where one is sort of establishing a new relationship with Ottawa. And yet we still annual basis issue our budget, deal with affordability measures. We have to take care of health care, education, vulnerable programs. It's in all of the above.

**WAYNE NELSON:** All right, I'm sure we'll get some more questions on that throughout the show. Some critics say that yesterday's release, which is the Friday before Christmas, instead of the originally announced December 31st date, looks to them like burying the report instead of inviting debate. What do you say to that?

## [02:59] Report Release Timing

**PREMIER DANIELLE SMITH:** Well, here we are talking about it. I don't want to bury it. I mean, I think the debate has happened. We had 22,000 people issue comments. We had 8,800,000 people watch the various panels online. We went to 10 different communities, had 5,000 people participate in person and many others who participated in the survey. So I would say it's a very high level of engagement. People have been waiting for it and now they see what it is that the panel is recommending. We will come back as a caucus and cabinet looking at the recommendations and seeing which ones we'll proceed on and which ones might go to a referendum of the people.

## [03:30] Citizen Petition Costs

**WAYNE NELSON:** Elections Alberta is managing those multiple recall and citizen initiative petitions which could cost taxpayers millions of dollars and require extensive verification work. In fact, I believe 3 million has already been approved for that purpose. What's your response to those concerned about that cost and whether this process risks detracting from other priorities?

**PREMIER DANIELLE SMITH:** Well, I agree. I don't think that this was how it was intended. And when we look at what happened in bc, which is very similar legislation, it's only been used about 30 times in 30 years. So I think that's why my predecessor thought that that was probably a pretty good model for recall legisl legislation, as it turns out. I think it's been there's an abusive process going on. They're trying because it doesn't take that much to launch one. All you have to do is write 100 angry words, pay 500 bucks and open a bank account and hire a CFO. So there's a lot more work that has to happen after that. You have to go out and get the signatures. And so that's what we're waiting to see if any of them are going to be successful in getting to that signature mark. And if not, then we'll have to assess whether or not the legislation needs to change in the spring, in the fall.

**WAYNE NELSON:** We had a number of text messages on our last show that I wasn't able to get to simply because of time and the number of texts and phone calls that we deal with regularly. Regarding the private school funding petition, it seeks a referendum on ending public funding to private schools or independent schools, about 70% of student public funding while serving around 6% of the students. Now, supporters say that redirecting those taxpayer dollars Back into the public school system would help address some of the overcrowding and chronic staffing shortages that were identified during the recent teachers strike. Opponents say that removing the funding from private schools could destabilize education choice options and hurt families using those schools. So does your government have a position then, premier Smith, on whether public funds should prioritize the public system over private schools?

## [05:36] Private School Funding

**PREMIER DANIELLE SMITH:** Well, I look at it differently. We've got about 100,000 students who go to either a homeschooling or a charter school or an independent school. And if you tried to take all of those hundred thousand students and put them into our existing public school system, it would collapse the system. There just isn't space for them. So I would say we look at that. We're kind of grateful to parents that they're willing to pay a portion of the cost of their kids education. It saves taxpayer money. For every child who is in a charter school, they're about equivalent. They're not allowed to charge tuition. But for every child who's in an independent school, US at least $5,000 per child and for every child who's homeschooled, they only get $850. That saves us almost $12,000 per child. So that's the way people should look at it is that these are tax paying parents that are not only willing to pay their fair share of taxes to support everybody else's education, but they're also willing to take on the cost of their own kids education. And if all of those kids were in the public system being paid at the same level that every other child in the public system is being paid at, that would cost taxpayers an additional $500 million. So it a little bit differently. I think that the, the fact that we do have parents that want choice and are willing to support choice with their own dollars, I think that we should be grateful to them.

**WAYNE NELSON:** All right, let's get to the phone and text lines. And here we have that. That old question that comes up at least once a show. Teresa is calling from Edmonton on. She wants some clarification on the ADAP situation. Go ahead, Theresa, you're on with the premiere.

## [07:10] AISH Program Clarification

**CALLER:** Oh, my goodness. I can't believe I can actually ask the question to the premier.

**PREMIER DANIELLE SMITH:** Hi, Theresa.

**CALLER:** Hi. Oh, I'm so grateful for you. I tell you, you give me hope. My, my kids want to put a. Buy me a poster and put you up in my bedroom wall.

**PREMIER DANIELLE SMITH:** Oh, that's so sweet. Thanks, Teresa.

**CALLER:** I have a son who is 40 and my, my husband and I have been advocates for him, for his, you know, life. He's autistic and on age. So when the federal government stepped in and said we had to apply, it was very confusing. My husband's an engineer and I'm a clerk. So we're not, you know, struggling, trying to understand things, but it was confusing for us. And we did get it applied. And I know now because of the explanation is that you have deducted $200 because the federal government gave us $200 to make it. My son gets the same. 1900. That's how it works.

**PREMIER DANIELLE SMITH:** Correct.

**CALLER:** And it's all good for us. But there's many people on Facebook and the post that I see that I find very frustrating because they are not understanding and they say they're only getting 1700 still. So I think there's many people that are on the age program that are confused on how to apply for the new credit. Sorry, benefits.

**PREMIER DANIELLE SMITH:** Yeah, I think you're right. I mean, one of the things that we've discovered, we have always had a policy that anyone who' receiving social benefits have to pursue all income from all sources. And it's not that unusual for somebody to get CPP and oas and gis when they're a senior. It's not that unusual for someone to be on a CPP disability benefit and then also be getting H to compensate. So I think that most people who require these supports have been doing that. What happened is that the federal government was worried that there's too big a drop off between some of the disability programs or too big a disparity between some of the disability programs and what you get when you're in retirement. So they've challenged all of the provinces to come up to 1,865. And there's a lot of provinces who have a lot further way to go. There are many that are $500 or more dollars per month less than us. So we were already above. And so what we've just said is it's our policy to pursue all income from all sources. I know that there's been some frustration in navigating through the federal process. We have only 18% that the feds have so far. There's about 50% where the paperwork is in and the federal government is processing, but there's about 24% who haven't even applied. And so we are trying. We've been calling them multiple times. We contacted them, we've spoken to them by phone, by mail, in person. And we just really want to encourage those folks to apply so that they can get access to those additional $200. And so I'm not sure why they're not. We're going to keep on working with them, but we want everybody to get the full amount of money that they're entitled to from all sour.

**WAYNE NELSON:** All right. We've got lots of texts, some great questions by the way, on the text line, both on the QR line and on the chat line. I'm going to try to get to as many as we can. But right now we're going to pause for a break. More of those calls and texts when we return on your province, your premier, If you're just joining us today, you are listening to your province, your premier herds for the most part every other Saturday morning for listeners throughout Elk Alberta, in Edmonton on 880 Chad right here in Calgary on QR Calgary. All right, we're going to go right to the phones because we want to get some further clarification. And this is on our first caller talking about Ace. Jerry from Westlock, go ahead. You are on to the premier with your Ace question.

## [10:54] AISH Application Barriers

**CALLER:** Good morning Premier. Hey Jerry, how are you this morning?

**PREMIER DANIELLE SMITH:** Great. What's on your mind.

**CALLER:** In regards to ace? I know I only can ask one question but the previous caller mentioned how confusing it was and like her, I understood it from the get go. But I've been getting calls myself because I do understand it. The 24% you speak of that haven't applied either don't have access to or have a family doctor for myself. And you know that you have to apply for the tax credit first.

**CALLER:** To.

**CALLER:** Be eligible to apply for the benefit. Having said that, that's four doctor's appointments and I have a family doctor one to tell him we have to do paperwork. He says I don't have time now. Rebook and we'll do it. So that's two for the tax credit, two more for the benefit. Same thing because you got to wait till you're approved for the tax credit. What I'm trying to say is it's not only confusing a burden on the health care system as a whole which is already short in this province that people the 24% don't have access to for numerous different reasons. Not only is it confusing, the communications you've talked about came out September 5th. Do this or you're going to be deducted $200. Yet the instructions on what to do were dated September 24th. So the communication was terrible. Then in on top of that you throw in, not only that, you're going to automatically be deducted $200 starting July 1, which is what people see. I understand it's carried over until December 2026, but a lot of people don't. All they see is they can't pay their cable bill. All right, what are you doing with the $15 million that you're saving that Mr. Carney has offered to your disability people? Handicapped people and income support people? And second to that.

**WAYNE NELSON:** Have you ever.

**CALLER:** Considered maybe pushing back, adapt?

**WAYNE NELSON:** Okay, Jerry, those are a couple great questions.

**PREMIER DANIELLE SMITH:** They are great questions. And thanks for being so clear and articulating what some of the barriers. I've already sent a note. There was a story I read this morning. I've already sent a note to my assisted living and social services minister to see if there's a way that we could have our own approved doctors be able to do these kinds of assessments, because some of the dollar figure figures we saw in that one report of $430 to go see a doctor seemed pretty high to us. So I'm going to have a look at that because that may be one of the issues. Look, our preference would have been for the federal government to just integrate with our program. That's what we offered them. We said, we already have this program in place. Why don't you just integrate with us so that people don't have to go through the rigmarole of having to apply? And the federal government refused. And so we've always had this program that again, what if somebody qualifies for guaranteed income supplement as a senior? And they say to us, well, I don't want to apply, therefore you should pay me. That's not how our programs work. You have to apply for all of the programs that are available to you now. Yes, the federal government for sure could have made it a lot easier. And I will work with Nixon to see if there's a way that we can bridge that gap. We're giving people enough time so that as long as they're in the application queue, we're certainly not going to leave anyone short until they get those additional dollars from the federal government. I wish that they'd integrated with us. They didn't. We think that there's. We just want to make sure everybody gets the dollars. And I should just mention, I mean, we are still indexing the total sum. So next year, the total sum people in Alberta will be able to get is $1,940 a month. The next closest province is three to five hundred dollars less than that. So we're very, very generous and we just want to make sure that everybody is getting their proper entitlement from the federal government. So we'll work with you to try to make that happen. When it comes to ada, one of the issues we found is we needed to add two additional programs. So those who are over the age of 60 who are clearly not going to be able to work, or those who have a mental capacity of 70 or below, that's sort of the general understanding of what somebody who is severely handicapped is. They are not going to be on either of those two programs. We recognize that we need to maintain that. However, there are lots of people who are temporarily disabled or only partially disabled still able to work. And we want them to be able to work to the full amount of their ability rather than feel confined with a program that doesn't allow them to work and getting clawed back. That's what the second program is. The third program is some people can even earn market wages, but they don't have a pharmacare program. So the third program that we've now added in is a pharmacare program to make sure that we're bridging that gap as well. So it's two additional programs, but the ACE structure is still there.

**WAYNE NELSON:** What about Jerry's assertion that the province is still getting the federal dollars?

**PREMIER DANIELLE SMITH:** They're coming. No, they're coming directly to the individual. I mean, it would have been better if they had done it the other way because we would have made sure that nobody got disrupted. But they want to send the money directly and that's the reason why people have to apply. We're not getting those dollars.

**WAYNE NELSON:** All right, let's go to. Randall is calling for a youth initiative program. Question. Just going to make sure Randall is ready to go on the air. Yes, go ahead. Randall, you're on with Premier Smith.

## [16:55] Youth Trades Incentives

**CALLER:** Howdy, ma'.

**PREMIER DANIELLE SMITH:** Am.

**CALLER:** How you doing? I'd just like to ask. I have a lot of interaction with youth and in three different communities, Claire's Home, Stavely and Nant and surrounding areas as well. And I'd like to know what we're doing to incentivize these young people to get into the trades, to get into the workforce. We're not doing enough to show them that this is a great way to increase your education.

**CALLER:** Trades are.

**CALLER:** It's free to go to trade school here. When I talk to these young men, I don't talk to young ladies as much, but I do have conversations with them. And they're in these groups and they want to go to school, they want to do better. But we don't do enough to incentive to give them incentive. These kids, they're used to the laziness on the video games and stuff. I'd like to see something where, if we get these young guys in the trades and they pass and they can save some money in the bank, maybe there's some way that the government can say, listen, if you're going to hold this money in the bank and you're going to save that, we can somehow we can give you something extra. Like, here's $100. You saved 10 grand this year, or you saved 5 grand this year. Something to incentivize them to get to school. We need to do more with public advertising and stuff. I don't think we do anything, ma', am, to this. Tom, we need to get you into school. This is what happens. You can be a carpenter, a plumber, you know, an electrician, a welder, all these great things. And they wanted young men. I can't speak so much for young ladies, but young. My daughter wants to be a welder, for instance, so. So I know it's out there, but there's not a lot of incentive. There's not the rap program. It's an okay program, but it's kind of makes it obtuse in a lot of ways. It needs to be a lot more inclusive. We need to have more opportunities for our young kids to get out into the workforce while they're still young, while they still want that ambition and they don't know about social programming and welfare and all the stuff that's going to keep them in pajamas in the middle of the day. We don't need that for them, and they don't want it. I honestly believe our youth just need a bump. They need a push. They need a little incentive. They need to hear from our leaders. We care about you, and this is what we're doing for you. This is just my thoughts, but is there anything we can do about our kids?

**PREMIER DANIELLE SMITH:** Well, yeah, and we're asking the business community to help us with that. One of the things that we kept seeing is a very high youth unemployment rate. It was as high as 20%. It's now thankfully down to 13.5%. And so we created this youth unemployment initiative where we as the government will subsidize an employer who's willing to give a kid a chance, will pay $10 an hour for their first 400. Then they can get exposed to what it's like to work on a shop floor, what it's like to manage equipment, what it's like to be a laborer. They can work with people who are in the trades. We can't do this ourselves. I mean, you have to remember part of the issue we're facing is that if you've got a child who grows up in a household where parents and all the adults in his life go and do an office job and don't do a trades job, then they go to school and they are in a school where there aren't trades exposure. How are they supposed to know what they don't know? They don't know that there's three or four hundred different professions out there. So we're asking employers to help us out on this one. There's a wonderful program in Airdrie McKee homes and what they do is they've set up a classroom on site so that two teachers come out and teach the academic courses and then the kids build homes in the afternoon and then there's a switch. The kids who are building homes then go on the academic courses and then the other cohort goes and builds homes in the afternoon. That was just the initiative of a business owner who worked with their local Rocky View school board to make that happen. So we are more than happy to enable those kinds of things, but we do need to have willing employers who are willing to work with us to take that risk. As we know, anyone who's starting off brand new in a job, they're not going to be perfect at it. There's going to be a lot of training, there's going to be a lot of safety that has to be learned. But it is going to be a collective effort. So we're doing that. We're also doing dual credit. Every time I speak to the Alberta School Boards Association, I challenge them to set up specialty schools. We've got an aviation academy down in Medicine Hat. We've got two agriculture schools also down in my riding end area. And we've got a wonderful program that is up in the Lacrete area that I think exposes kids with a virtual learning device so they can sit into it and they can manage Earth movers and all of that. I think they can get exposed up to 30 different professions up there. So yeah, we're doing all of that. But I do think it's going to be up to the business community to partner with us. We got to take a chance on these kids to expose them to the kind of incredible opportunities there are.

**WAYNE NELSON:** Alright, I want to go to the text line and this one is on the Chad line from Mavis Now Mavis has a lot of critiques, but I wanted to focus on part of her text because it's fairly long. I'm not going to read the whole thing. She says people are not happy with the way you are railroading things. Your government figures we need to have. We do not need an extra police service. We do need extra help with the ones we got. This is in response to the Alberta Next panel report that says you will be moving ahead with the policing with the individual community policing.

## [21:59] Provincial Policing Plans

**PREMIER DANIELLE SMITH:** Well, I would say that that may be a misapprehension because part of the reason why they recommended just moving ahead with developing out our sheriffs as a police force is that Albertans have already decided 80% of Albertans are policed by a local police force. Calgary has a local police force. Edmonton, Medicine Hat, Lethbridge, Grand Prairie, Tabor, Camrose, Lacoma. Missing a couple indigenous communities are develop their own police force. I believe Sutina has one, Siksika has one. So it's really 20% or less of the population that are policed by the RCMP. Some communities, I think the larger ones, maybe Fort McMurray, Medicine Hat and Strathcona county are pretty happy with that because it's a large community. There's large detachment. They've got a lot of stability. But I can tell you those of us who represent and live in areas where it's a smaller detachment that is constantly under resourced, that has a difficult time attracting personnel that cannot get at call times, they are not happy with the level of service they're getting. So I'm supportive of the federal ambition. A white paper was released in March where they said that the RCMP should be our national police force. They should be doing terrorism and cross border crimes and drug trafficking, human trafficking, cyber crimes. There's a lot of work that our rcmp, very highly trained, should be focused on. And then we need to make sure that rural communities that somebody shows up when they call 911 and they don't have to wait hours or days for that to happen.

**WAYNE NELSON:** All right, let's go back to the phones. Sylvia is calling in from Lacombe. Go ahead, Sylvia. You're on with Premier Danielle Smith.

## [23:32] Oil Gas Cleanup

**CALLER:** Hello, can you hear me okay?

**PREMIER DANIELLE SMITH:** Sure can. Hi, Sylvia.

**CALLER:** Oh, good, thank you. I just wanted to say that the oil and gas companies out here aren't paying their land rents and they aren't cleaning up their well sites and they aren't paying their property tax bills either. So our municipalities municipal property taxes are going up and I just wondered what you're doing about that. I can tell you what I see it, and please don't take this the wrong way, but it looks like you're covering up for them, you know, doing yet another study or another plan or consulting people like this, I think they call it that mature asset, mature asset strategy. And it all comes back to us, like to the taxpayers, to the farmers, the guys we're covering up for, these oil and gas companies, you know, I think you need to start to work for us and not for them.

**PREMIER DANIELLE SMITH:** Well, Sylvia, I would say the exact opposite. And I've been a landowner advocate since 1997, and so I've known about this well site recovery problem since then, and it's been very much on my mind that once I got in office, I was going to fix it. So I can't change the fact that in 1936, when we drove, when we drilled the first well, we didn't require those operators to clean. There's two things that could, could have changed everything. If they had said that once you suspend a well and it's no longer active, you've got five years to clean it up. That's the policy they have in some jurisdictions. Or they could have said you have to put aside a closure fund so that when that well site comes up for renewal, there's money associated with cleaning it up. And they didn't do that. They didn't do it in the 30s or the 40s or the 50s or the 60s or the 70s. It only started beginning to happen with money set aside in the early mid 2000s. So here we are with a $30 billion liability, and on a go forward, we want to make sure that doesn't happen again. So that's exactly what we're talking about, is on wellsites on a go forward having closure funds in place. So they've got to put money aside so that when they. So that if they ever transfer it, there's going to be money there to clean it up. And then we also have mandatory spend, so they are required, and have been for three or four years, to spend $700 million a year cleaning up those wells to sites. The next step we have to do is to connect the nominated sites from landowners, and there's about 1200 of them. If a landowner nominates a site and a company has to spend a certain amount of money reclaiming it, we want to connect that and say, no, that's the one that you've got to reclaim first. And then we have to make sure that there's a more robust system. For identifying the bad actors. The problem that we discovered is that property taxes, when they're unpaid, you don't necessarily find that out until a year after the fact because they only collect once a year. The landowners are taken care of because there's a process that they can go to the Surface Rights Board and we as a provincial government pay them. So landowners should never be out of pocket on that. And if anybody is, you should tell them to use the section 36 under the act that governs this to go to the tribunal and be able to get their money. But our objective is this. And the whole purpose of the asset management strategy was get the property taxes paid, get the landowner leases paid. If you've got bad actors, then get them out of operation and make sure that the assets are in the hand of somebody who can manage it appropriately. And let's start digging down on that $30 billion of liability to get it cleared. It's going to take some time. It didn't happen overnight. But I can tell you I'm committed to making sure that it's resolved for the future.

**WAYNE NELSON:** All right, we'll switch gears for this next question. Why did the province decide to allow game ranching in Alberta? Again, this was a disaster last time we tried it here. You must be aware of how dangerous it is to our existing wildlife populations.

## [27:25] Game Ranching Concerns

**PREMIER DANIELLE SMITH:** Well, I guess because Quebec is doing it and Saskatchewan's doing it. So they've found a way to do it safely. And we had been asked by those who are in this industry to find a way to make it viable. So we'll watch, of course. I mean, Todd Lowen is an outdoorsman himself, a conservationist as well, and he certainly does not want to do anything that would impact wildlife populations so that we can still have robust hunting seasons and trapping season. We'll monitor it. But it does seem to me that things have changed with Quebec and Saskatchewan finding a way to do it. And we think it's worth us giving it a try to see if we can too.

## [28:01] Climate Course Curriculum

**WAYNE NELSON:** Interesting text here. The texter said, my son is in grade six in the RVS school division. Who dictates the class curriculum? The reason I'm asking is my son is taking a climate course that is supposed to be part of their science class. Long story short, the videos they show are American by the WWF and other organizations pushing an unfair agenda on 11 year old kids. Any insight is appreciated.

**PREMIER DANIELLE SMITH:** Well, we set the things that we believe kids should learn at each grade level. And then the teachers have a lot of latitude for the resources that they're going to use on how that is taught. We think we may have to allow for more resources to be developed by our provincial department. I've been talking with Demetrios Nicolaides about that, that that may be one of the ways that we're able to take the pressure off the implementation of new curriculum and also that there's balanced resources. I think that's one of the things that I'm hearing in your question is are the kids being taught the full range of perspectives, including how valuable the energy sector is and how responsible they've been in developing their resources and how they're working on reducing emissions overall? So I'll take that away. But we're having an active conversation about whether there are some curriculum resources that we should be making available to all teachers across the province.

**WAYNE NELSON:** Peter is calling in from Red Deer with a question about charter school programs. Go ahead, Peter. You're on with the premier.

## [29:29] Charter School Education

**CALLER:** Well, thank you for taking my call. Where it's coming from is I'm a huge fan of charter and private schools and I have a little apprehension, you know, If a referendum is held that the public wouldn't have enough information, is there any way that we could have some sort of, for lack of a better word, an education program, little sound bites of things that charter schools do. Like did you know an example? Did you know that private schools have their own busing systems? That could be just one, but there might be a thousand little songbites.

**PREMIER DANIELLE SMITH:** That.

**CALLER:** Would help to prepare people if they are confronted with would you sign this petition or an actual referendum if it goes that far?

**PREMIER DANIELLE SMITH:** Well, thanks for that, Peter. I would say there's sort of two different things that we're talking about there. So charter schools are public schools. It's just instead of being sponsored by a school board, they're sponsored directly by the minister of education. So they don't have to go through an intermediary to get their per student funding. They get it directly from the province. They're not allowed to charge tuition. They're just not attached to a particular school board. So we'll park that one for a minute because you're right, there are some really great charter schools out there. Independent schools are ones that can charge a tuition and a couple come to mind that are really unique. Like Renfrew School in Calgary. It is one that deals with learning disabilities and it is an extraordinary program. So much so that we look to that as a way of seeing are there things that we're doing that we should replicate in the publicly funded system. Same thing. I think there's a new autistic school that has started up in Edmonton, an independent school that I'm quite interested to see if they have any techniques for kids who are on the spectrum to see that we can bring them into the public system. But part of what happens with independent schools is that the parents see that there isn't quite a match for their unique needs of their kids in the public school available. And so they want to have another option option. And if it does get to a point where they have a number of signatures that allow for a referendum campaign, I suspect there'll be a yes side and a no side and there'll be lots of sound bites and lots of advertising and lots of third parties who are participating in that. So that Albertans are fully aware, as you can tell. I mean, this is our policy. So we're supportive of continuing to support parents in the choice that they have, especially since it saves taxpayers and it also allows for us to have unique programs that we ultimately can learn from that everybody can benefit from.

**WAYNE NELSON:** On that note, a texter, Laurel says let's be realistic. Premier Smith, 100,000 people in other types of education are not going to come in to public education. Those parents are going to happily pay 100% of the cost for their private school at Weber Academy.

## [32:40] Private School Costs

**PREMIER DANIELLE SMITH:** Well, I guess I have to ask then, why would that person think that that that person should pay 100% of their child's cost and 100% of their neighbor's child's cost? That seems a little bit unusual. It seems to me that these taxpayers are willing to not only pay their fair share of taxes which help to subsidize the system, but then also take on a portion of the cost personally so that their own children can get educated. I just see it a little bit differently. I think that the fact that you've got kids who are in these programs and again, some of these programs are just not offered in the public education system like the two I just described. I sure wouldn't want to see those shut down.

## [33:21] Senior School Taxes

**WAYNE NELSON:** And that dovetails nicely into this question from Carol on our text line. She said, our concern is that as retired seniors, why are we still having to pay school taxes? We are happy and appreciate those parents who are paying into their kids education. Can you do something about parents of school children paying school taxes rather than.

**PREMIER DANIELLE SMITH:** Every well, everybody's got to pay for the future generation. It's that future generation that gets out and has a good paying job that pays for all of the programs that we care for that we that we need, including income supports for CPP and OAS and gis. So I guess it's a philosophical difference, but I do think that everybody needs to pay collectively for the benefit of the next generation. That's part of how we structured our tax system. There are programs in place where you can get a freeze on education, property tax if you're in a position where it's a hardship for you. But generally speaking, I think we should all be supportive of young people getting educated to the best that we can do for them.

**WAYNE NELSON:** Lots of phone calls today, lots of text messages on a variety of topics. We're going to pause for an early break and come back. You are listening to your province, your premiere, Wayne Nelson, back with you on your province, your premier, your opportunity to speak Premier Danielle Smith, one on one. If you've got that specific question you'd like answered, please phone or text. And if you don't know those numbers by now, here they are once Again in Calgary, 403-974-8255. In Edmonton. What is our number in Edmonton? It is an 880 number and I've made misplaced that number. But our Edmonton phone callers know that number and they are phoning in. Let's go to John in Calgary right off the bat. John, go ahead. You're on with the premier.

## [35:18] Wildrose Party Legacy

**CALLER:** Thank you for taking my call. Hey John, my question is about the Wild Rose program. Your government seems to be following along that program of the Wild Rose party. I just want to comment about your comment about how locked in to the Wild Rose program your government is using right now.

**PREMIER DANIELLE SMITH:** Like what are you referring to exactly?

**CALLER:** The, the idea of independence of policing and what do you call it, just more looking after ourselves?

**PREMIER DANIELLE SMITH:** Well, I don't know. I look at that as going back to some really great conservative thinkers. I mean, Stephen Harper signed the firewall letter all the way back in 2001. Ted Morton was part of that. Reinernoff and Barry Cooper, those are part of the Calgary school. So that's where those ideas came from. That was well before Wild Rose even existed. I think they also came about as a result of Premier Kenney doing the Alberta Next panel discussion when the UCP got in. Those were things that the people who participated in that process asked him to pursue. So we're just, we're trying to refine to see how much more broadly we should be going on some of those historic policies. But this has been a long conversation. I think that goes back from my recollection 25 years.

**WAYNE NELSON:** Does it Result from Alberta's dissatisfaction with preferential treatment for Quebec?

## [36:59] Quebec Federal Treatment

**PREMIER DANIELLE SMITH:** Well, there's a few perception of, I would say there's a couple things. I mean, one of the things that came out and Michael Binion I think really described this well during our Alberta next is that the constitutional arrangement we have with the federal government is constantly changing. Alberta was Rupert's Land and then it was Northwest Territories and then we considered being the Buffalo Province for a while, but we ultimately became Alberta and then we got our Resource Transfer act so that we could take more control of our resources. And then Peter Lougheed advocated for some things in the repatriation of the Constitution. So it is evolving towards a province taking on more and more responsibilities as it becomes capable of doing so. And in Quebec, they've gone the full nine yards. They collect their own taxes, they have their own pension, they have their own police, they have their own immigration system. And so it was should we be doing the same things as Quebec is doing was sort of the overarching framework, I think of a lot of our.

**WAYNE NELSON:** Discussions or should we be getting the same, same treatment that Quebec was getting?

**PREMIER DANIELLE SMITH:** I can tell you how frustrating it is that we're running a deficit and we're going to run a deficit next year because of an out of control approach that the federal government took largely on newcomers. We were accustomed to getting. We're finally back to 380,000 to 450,000 under this new Prime Minister. But for a few years there, there were no limits on any of the programs, no limits on refugees, no limits on international students, no limits on the temporary foreign. 2 million people a year came into the country. So we are under pressure. And so meanwhile we look at how much we transfer to Ottawa versus what we get back in benefits and they get $26 billion more from Alberta taxpayers than we receive back. And then Quebec gets a $13.9 billion transfer on equalization and we get zero and Manitoba gets 5 billion. And people are very frustrated because we work hard, we know we pay our taxes, but then to also run deficits because there isn't a fair amount of those dollars coming back. Yeah, I think that causes a lot of frustration.

**WAYNE NELSON:** Randy has texted in. He said, please ask Premier Smith when we will get a response from the Feds onto Alberta's share of the cpp.

## [39:08] CPP Response Timeline

**PREMIER DANIELLE SMITH:** I just had a conversation with the Prime Minister about that yesterday. I wanted to give him a heads up that this Alberta Next panel was coming and that there's a few things that I would hope that we could work together on. For instance, the appointment of justice judges to the King's bench in the Court of Appeal. The panel recommended that we have a referendum on abolishing the Senate. I think we've tried out west to reform it for decades and gotten nowhere. So I just wanted to let him know that that was coming as well. But the issue around the pension, I said the law says that pensions are provincial responsibility and that we've chosen to be part of the national plan. But we can choose to. We have the authority to be able to choose to opt out, but their actuary won't us a firm number. So I did let them know that we should at least know what that number is so that Albertans know what the benefit level is and contribution level is. If there was an independent plan, we also need to know what our liability is and what the asset value would be. So we've started that conversation with the prime minister and we'll continue it. But what I took from the panel is there can be no referendum until those things are settled. No one's going to vote unless they know what those parameters are. So I'll work very hard to get those parameters. Haven't been able to get them so far. But we've got a new prime minister so we'll see if I can get some them from him now that this report is out.

**WAYNE NELSON:** All right. Lorraine is phoning in from Calgary with a victims of crime question. Go ahead, Lorraine.

## [40:31] Victims of Crime

**CALLER:** Hi, Premier. Thank you for all your work you're doing for Alberta and the Albertans.

**PREMIER DANIELLE SMITH:** Thank you.

**CALLER:** My question is about the victims of crime program, if there is one. We have a young fellow that we are very familiar with who was walking home from work. He was stabbed five times. Paramedics saved his life, perpetrators in prison. But he hasn't been able to work for two years. He's had four or five surgeries in that five, two years. And there doesn't seem to be any access or we're not aware of or how he can access any type of help. He's lost his home. He's basically living with a friend and he wants to get back on his feet, but he wants to get working as soon as he's physically able, but he has no access to anything.

**WAYNE NELSON:** Your question, Lorraine?

**CALLER:** Is the victim of crimes program available?

**PREMIER DANIELLE SMITH:** Well, we do have victims of crime. We set up a network because we had found that there were only 60 communities that were covered by victims of crime fund. And so we do have a fund. We have an application that you can make through Alberta government's justice and Solicitor general portal. So if you go through Alberta ca, there is a. There are a number of different grants that you can get here. I should look into that a little bit more because I know that we use it most for counseling support for those who are coming to terms with having been a victim of crime. I might need to understand a little bit more about whether there is direct support for an individual to, as you say, help them get back on their feet. So let me see if I can take this away and come up with an answer for you next time I'm on the air, and then we'll see if there's a pathway. But in the meantime, just go onto Alberta ca, type in Victims of Crime Fund, and then just see if you can see if there's an application avenue that might allow him to get the support that he needs. I'm sorry that he's had to go. That. It's got to be pretty devastating.

**WAYNE NELSON:** All right. Our last phone call for this show, and I'm allowing time for answers. This is from Gail regarding Bill C9. Go ahead, Gail. You are on with the premier.

## [42:55] Bill C-9 Religious Exemption

**PREMIER DANIELLE SMITH:** Oh, hi.

**CALLER:** Merry Christmas to both you and the premier. Hey, Gail, thank you for slogging through this every second Saturday.

**PREMIER DANIELLE SMITH:** It's not a slog. I love talking to you.

**CALLER:** And also thank you for standing for women and children on the transition. That's very much appreciated.

**PREMIER DANIELLE SMITH:** My pleasure.

**CALLER:** And my last question is, is the province going to be doing anything with regard to the religious exemption on the federal bill C9?

**PREMIER DANIELLE SMITH:** Yeah, thanks for that. I'm watching that with great interest to see how it is being implemented. I think one of the issues, and it's being driven out of Quebec. I think in Quebec, they're very concerned that some of the newcomer populations are not integrated into their secular way of managing their province, as you saw. I mean, they remove religious symbols. You're not allowed to wear religious garments if you work in public service. So they are doing it under the auspices of maintaining their Quebec secular culture and language. And so that's what they felt they needed some additional tools for because there has been a lot of conflict in Quebec society in recent years. I don't, I don't think it's intended to go after pastors reading scripture from a pulpit. But you know what? This is the unpredictable thing that happens when politicians pass laws. Then they turn it over to the courts and the prosecutors and the police to interpret. And sometimes it can be interpreted in an unexpected way. So I'm talking with Mickey Amory, my justice minister, to see if there are any guardrails we need to put down. As you saw, we just recently created policy on our policing priorities which incidentally do not include include going after law abiding gun owners on the gun grab, nor does it include going after those who defend themselves against an intruder. So we've given direction. That's not a policing priority or a prosecution priority. We may have to add to the list going after pastors. Reading the bible is also not a priority when it comes to policing these crimes. I think what we're trying to get at is if you are saying something that puts another group at risk because of your words. That was always what a hate crime was supposed to be, not religious texts. So I think they've gone a step too far. We'll have to see what we can do about that though.

**WAYNE NELSON:** Final question, Premier Smith. What's one concrete improvement you'd like to see in Albertans lives by the end of 2026?

## [45:13] Closing Question

**PREMIER DANIELLE SMITH:** Oh, so much on healthcare. I wish I could say just one, but it's what I'm looking forward to. Seeing people get attached to a family doctor or nurse practitioner, improving the patient experience to get into surgery, clearing the surgical background backlog. Those are the things that we're working really hard on next year and we're finally at the point where we finished all of our restructuring and so now we get to implement and I'm looking forward to really greatly improving the patient experience.

**WAYNE NELSON:** That's our last show for the year. Thanks for joining us.

**PREMIER DANIELLE SMITH:** You bet. Thanks, Wayne. See you in the new year.

**WAYNE NELSON:** And thank you for listening, for calling in and texting your questions and concerns. And by the way, that number, yes, I know, is a little late but. 780-451-8800. That's the number from Edmonton, but you can save that for our next show. We'll be back January 24th. That'll be the first show of 2026 on your province. Your premiere.
